Avería font family
========================


This file provides detailed information on the Avería family of fonts. This
information should be distributed along with the Avería fonts and any
derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Avería ("breakdown" or "mechanical damage" in Spanish - related to the root
of the English word "average") is a Unicode typeface family created from the
average of all fonts on the computer of the creator, Dan Sayers. The process
is described at http://iotic.com/averia/. All metrics are the result of an
averaging process. The included glyphs are those that existed in a majority
of the source fonts - which are the following:

Range           Description
U+0020-U+007E   Basic Latin
U+00A0-U+00FF   Latin-1 Supplement

And some glyphs from the following:

Range           Description
U+0100-U+017F   Latin Extended-A
U+0180-U+021F   Latin Extended-B
U+02B0-U+02FF   Spacing Modifier Letters
U+0370-U+03D5   Greek
U+2000-U+2122   General Punctuation
U+2200-U+25CS   Mathematical Operators

Avería exists in Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic, Light and Light Italic
styles - as well as a "Gruesa" semi-italic variant made from an average of
all 725 source fonts.
